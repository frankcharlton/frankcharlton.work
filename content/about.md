My soul thrives on **deep processing, creative thinking, storytelling, and making things**. My career has been anything but conventional, and I wouldn't change a thing. Every step has shaped how I think and approach problems in unique ways.

I started in **music production**, working as a teen in Nashville, graduating from **Berklee College of Music**, and working in some of LA's finest recording studios. Music taught me the power of **iteration, collaboration, and deep listening**—skills that turned out to be incredibly valuable in software testing and data science. 

My passion for **breaking things to make them better** led me into **software testing and leadership**, where I thrived in **skill building, process improvement, and leading scrum teams**. I worked closely with developers, UX designers, and product managers, continuously pushing for higher software quality. 

Eventually, my curiosity for analytics evolved into **data science**, where I now work closely with **executives, engineers, product managers, UX professionals, and software testers** to uncover insights that drive real impact. By the end of my tenure at Sonos, I was regularly presenting to our executives, leveraging frameworks I had built from scratch.
