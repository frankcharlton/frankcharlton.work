:wave: After a 14.5 year run at [Sonos](https://sonos.com) I am off to my next adventure. Making some music and art for a bit while I think about what's next. Feel free to reach out through [Linkedin](https://sonos.com) for now. Fancy data science portfolio website and blog coming soon...

## data scientist / creative thinker / storyteller

I’ve had an unconventional career—starting in **music production**, transitioning into **software testing**, and eventually finding my passion in **data science**. My work combines **deep analysis**, **creative problem-solving**, and **storytelling** to uncover insights that drive impact.
